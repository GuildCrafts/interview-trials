## How to Use This Repo

If you are an **interviewee** (i.e. you are using this to practice your interviewing skills), use the `interviews/` subdirectory to log your mock interviews.

When you do a mock interview, follow these steps:

1. Make a new file in the `interviews/` folder with the format `YYYYMMDD-NAME.md`, using the date of the mock interview and your name (e.g. `interviews/20161228-Ada-Lovelace.md`)
1. Copy the contents of the `interviews/INTERVIEW_TEMPLATE.md` file into your new mock interview file
1. Update the information in your mock interview file
1. Do the mock interview with an interviewer
1. Once you are done
  - fill out the "Reflection" section
  - have the interviewer update the mock interview file with their questions and evaluation

If you are an **interviewer**, add your questions to the `questions/` subdirectory so that other interviewers can reference and use them. Also, you will be asked by the interviewee to write your evaluations in their mock interview file.
